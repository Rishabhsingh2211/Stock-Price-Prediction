# Stock-Price-Prediction
# Introduction
In this project, we use machine learning to predict stock prices using time series data. We collect historical stock price data, preprocess the data to remove outliers and engineer features, and build a machine learning model to make predictions. We also deploy the machine learning model as a web application.

Introduction
In this section, we provide an overview of the project, including the problem statement, project goals, and dataset used.

Data Collection
In this section, we describe how we collect historical stock price data using the Yahoo Finance API.

Data Preprocessing
In this section, we describe how we preprocess the collected data to remove outliers and engineer features. We also create rolling statistics and lagged features.

Feature Engineering
In this section, we describe how we further process the preprocessed data to create additional features that may improve the performance of the machine learning model.

Supervised Machine Learning Model
In this section, we describe how we build a machine learning model using the preprocessed and engineered features. We explore linear regression and random forest regression models, but other models could also be used.

Conclusion
In this section, we summarize the project and discuss potential areas for future work. We also provide some final thoughts on the project and its applications.

Overall, this project provides a framework for building a stock price predictor using time series data. It can be extended to other time series prediction problems or other types of financial data. The project is implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and joblib.
